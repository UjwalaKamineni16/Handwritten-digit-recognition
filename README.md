# Requirements

* Python 3.5 +
* Scikit-Learn (latest version)
* Numpy (+ mkl for Windows)
* Matplotlib

# Usage

1. Download the four MNIST dataset files from this link:
[dataset from here](https://github.com/anujdutt9/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning/blob/master/dataset.zip), unzip the files and place them in the respected folders.**

2.Unzip and place the files in the dataset folder inside the MNIST_Dataset_Loader folder under each ML Algorithm folder i.e :

KNN
|_ MNIST_Dataset_Loader
   |_ dataset
      |_ train-images-idx3-ubyte
      |_ train-labels-idx1-ubyte
      |_ t10k-images-idx3-ubyte
      |_ t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte

Do this for SVM and RFC folders and you should be good to go.


## Accuracy using Machine Learning Algorithms:

i)	 K Nearest Neighbors: 96.67%

ii)	 SVM:	97.91%

iii) Random Forest Classifier:	96.82%
